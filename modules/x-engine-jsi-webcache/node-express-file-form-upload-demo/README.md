### Install this solution to run locally

1. FORK /CLONE 
Get over to github and clone or fork/clone… (if you want to help me make it better, (yes, please!)) … my demo repository for this solution. https://github.com/Lazercat/node-express-file-form-upload-demo.

2. INSTALL NPM PACKAGES
 Once cloned locally, run an npm install from your command line (bash/terminal) in the root folder where App.js is.
```npm install```

3. RUN THE APP
 I included the nodemon package in this project, so to run this solution on your localhost just type the following code. As you make changes, nodemon will automatically re-run it for you -neato, huh?
 ```nodemon App.js ```
 
4. VIEW/TEST LOCAL
